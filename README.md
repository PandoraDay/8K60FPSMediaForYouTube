# 8K60FPSMediaForYouTube
Scripts that I used for working and preparing media to upload 8K 7680x4320 60FPS (4320p60) to YouTube

Here, I share some scripts I used to work and upload 8K 7680x4320 60FPS Media to YouTube. Some of them are Windows CMD BATS, some of them are Powershell 7.5.0 PS1 Scripts. I am not by all means an expert.  I did this with help of Internet (AskUbuntu, Reddit, Stack Overflow, Super User, VideoHelp Forum, etc.) and AI such as Kimi AI, DeepSeek, ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot
